**Description:** Desertion is a two-player third-person racing game that was developed over the span of a weekend as part of the McGill GameDev Hackathon. The premise of the game is that two aliens managed to escape Area 51, but only one of them can board the escape ship! Each player can purchase obstacles to hinder their opponent's track during the run. They can also purchase powerups to enhance their abilities, such as speed and double jumps. May the player who reaches the alien saucer faster wins!

**Description:** Cabinet of Curiosities consists of a web application that offers a variety of features for the clients and employees of a fictional museum. This website allows the clients of the museum to browse the various artifacts available, donate their personal artifacts, rent out specific objects of the expositions for a duration of time, as well as simply buy tickets to visit the museum on a given day. Along with the features available for clients, the website also allows its staff to deal with the management of the museum, such as dealing with donated or rented artifacts and managing the currently displayed art pieces in its catalog. The manager of the museum can also create employee accounts and schedule them to work on specific days.

## [MushUrDoom](https://github.com/yu-an-lu/MushUrDoom) :mushroom:
**Start Date:** October 2022

**End Date:** October 2022

**Description:** MushUrDoom is an interactive browser game that was built over the course of a weekend as part of the McGill AI Society Hackathon. It consists of a questionnaire-type game that guides the player through a series of questions regarding a mushroom they have encountered during a hike in the forest. The player will describe the mushrooms using a variety of attributes such as color or shape. Once the questionnaire is completed, a decision tree is used to determine whether this description of a mushroom consists of a poisonous or edible mushroom. The training of the model was done with an extensive CSV file containing a variety of mushrooms, their attributes, and whether they were edible or poisonous.
